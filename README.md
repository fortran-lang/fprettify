fprettify is an auto-formatter for modern Fortran code that imposes strict whitespace formatting, written in Python.

**NOTE:** I'm looking for help to maintain this repository, see [#127](https://github.com/pseewald/fprettify/issues/127).

## Features

- Auto-indentation.
- Line continuations are aligned with the previous opening delimiter `(`, `[` or `(/` or with an assignment operator `=` or `=>`. If none of the above is present, a default hanging indent is applied.
- Consistent amount of whitespace around operators and delimiters.
- Removal of extraneous whitespace and consecutive blank lines.
- Change letter case (upper case / lower case conventions) of intrinsics
- Tested for editor integration.
- By default, fprettify causes whitespace changes only and thus preserves revision history.
- fprettify can handle cpp and [fypp](https://github.com/aradi/fypp) preprocessor directives.

## Limitations

- Works only for modern Fortran (Fortran 90 upwards).
- Feature missing? Please create an issue.

## Requirements

- Python 3 (Python 2.7 no longer supported)
- [ConfigArgParse](https://pypi.org/project/ConfigArgParse): optional, enables use of config file

## Examples

Compare `examples/*before.f90` (original Fortran files) with `examples/*after.f90` (reformatted Fortran files) to see what fprettify does. A quick demonstration:

```Fortran
program demo
integer :: endif,if,elseif
integer,DIMENSION(2) :: function
endif=3;if=2
if(endif==2)then
endif=5
elseif=if+4*(endif+&
2**10)
elseif(endif==3)then
function(if)=endif/elseif
print*,endif
endif
end program
```

```Fortran
program demo
   integer :: endif, if, elseif
   integer, DIMENSION(2) :: function
   endif = 3; if = 2
   if (endif == 2) then
      endif = 5
      elseif = if + 4*(endif + &
                       2**10)
   elseif (endif == 3) then
      function(if) = endif/elseif
      print *, endif
   endif
end program
```

## Installation

The latest release can be installed using pip:

```sh
pip install --upgrade fprettify
```

Installation from source requires Python Setuptools:

```sh
pip install .
```

For local installation, use `--user` option.

## Command line tool

Autoformat file1, file2, ... inplace by

```sh
fprettify file1, file2, ...
```

The default indent is 3. If you prefer something else, use `--indent n` argument.

In order to apply fprettify recursively to an entire Fortran project instead of a single file, use the `-r` option.

For more options, read

```sh
fprettify -h
```

## Configuration file

Adjusted parameters of `fprettify` can be stored in a configuration file in a pattern like

```sh
# Explicitly define / overwrite the program's defaults e.g.
indent=2
whitespace=0
```

The rules are activated by the optional parameter `-c` and subsequent indication of the config file in question. For one example of application, see the setup of [ABIN](https://github.com/PHOTOX/ABIN/blob/master/.fprettify.rc).

## Editor integration

For editor integration, use

```sh
fprettify --silent
```

For instance, with Vim, use fprettify with `gq` by putting the following commands in your `.vimrc`:

```vim
autocmd Filetype fortran setlocal formatprg=fprettify\ --silent
```

## Deactivation and manual formatting (experimental feature)

fprettify can be deactivated for selected lines: a single line followed by an inline comment starting with `!&` is not auto-formatted and consecutive lines that are enclosed between two comment lines `!&<` and `!&>` are not auto-formatted. This is useful for cases where manual alignment is preferred over auto-formatting. Furthermore, deactivation is necessary when non-standard Fortran syntax (such as advanced usage of preprocessor directives) prevents proper formatting. As an example, consider the following snippet of fprettify formatted code:

```fortran
A = [-1, 10, 0, &
     0, 1000, 0, &
     0, -1, 1]
```

In order to manually align the columns, fprettify needs to be deactivated by

```fortran
A = [-1,   10, 0, & !&
      0, 1000, 0, & !&
      0,   -1, 1]   !&
```

or, equivalently by

```fortran
!&<
A = [-1,   10, 0, &
      0, 1000, 0, &
      0,   -1, 1]
!&>
```

## Contributing / Testing

The testing mechanism allows you to easily test fprettify with any Fortran project of your choice. Simply clone or copy your entire project into `fortran_tests/before` and run `python setup.py test`. The directory `fortran_tests/after` contains the test output (reformatted Fortran files). If testing fails, please submit an issue!
